8/25: took some time to reproduce the playwright example. I should produce a minimal reproducible example of the issue I am having with playwright: https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example

I now need to fix the tests for the redux app such that they will pass with the redux setup before moving on"
